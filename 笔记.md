# Introduction

Good afternoon, everyone! My name is

likairui, my partners and I are glad to talk to you today about an increasingly critical topic: cybersecurity threats

## content

This page is our content,which includes  5 common threats and measure,interface and think tank

## phishing attacks    

First i'll introduce the phishing attacks

Phishing attack is a form of cyberattack where attackers impersonate trusted entities (like banks or companies) to deceive individuals into revealing  passwords , financial details or something else.

### So the biggest threat of phishing attacks is leak of sensitive information

## Defense

We now have three dimensions of defense: Technical,social and individual.

From the surface to the core,I confirm that the core of defense is the alert awareness.Everyone knows the features of phishing attacks so that everyone can protect themselves from this kind of cyber threat.where can we acquire these knowledge？Of course in our app！

## interface

This page is the education part. Look at the top of this page, there is a progress bar.Benefiting the principle of data visualization, users could clearly know their studying progress.

At the left of this page we can see that the dots used for categorizing correspond to the color of the progress bar,so users could visualize which parts have been learned.

The design of the colors and the progress bar motivate users to learn more about cybersecurity，and it may create a positive cycle in studying.

As the progress advances, users acquires a lot of knowledge without realizing it. And I think that’s what we trying to achieve.
